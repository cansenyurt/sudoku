# sudoku
Basic C code to solve a sudoku game. Not very complex but this was at the start of my coding journey.
It checks if a given sudoku table is legal and then tries to fill out missing values by using deduction.
Can not create "hypothetical" boards to solve more complex puzzles but can solve easy level ones :)
